### Liked

- The characters are extremely unique and offer different gameplay experiences.
- Getting further and further each run feels rewarding. The game is theoretically yet unrealistically endless.
- The visuals are very clean for how the small resolution is.
- The music is outstanding.
- Even the bad mutations are powerful.
- Late-game content like ultras and loop-exclusive bosses keep the game fresh.

### Disliked

- Moment-to-moment gameplay can result in potential difficulty spikes, and in rare cases, unfair situations.
- Runs become more similar as they proceed, rather than more varied. Many runs that loop are very similar.
- Taking crowns feels extremely un-rewarding.

### Informational

- The game punishes mistakes far more than most roguelikes. Things happen quickly.
- As an experienced player, runs typically remain rather short.
